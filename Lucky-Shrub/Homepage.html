                    Maintaining a traditional lawn can be a headache, especially when you live in a drought-prone region. Regular watering, fertilizing, and mowing can take chunks out of your schedule. Even with great upkeep and plenty of attention, your grass lawn may not prove a sustainable, long-term option.
